					<h1 class="heading">website release!</h1>
					<p>
					just finished the first public version of my website! and you're reading this blogpost on it RIGHT NOW!
					</p>
					<p>
					i've always wanted to make a personal website, and i think i did a pretty damn good job with this. it's not finished right now though. i still gotta setup the gallery page and do some touch-ups but other than that, it's ready for me to do whatever i want with it!
					</p>
					<h2 class="heading">some more personal fluff</h2>
					<p>
					school has been pretty tough recently i'll be honest. everything kinda went to shit last year, but i've been doing a bit better in recent times. this year has started off rough though. i've currently got 7 missing assignments under my belt, and im failing one class. things could be better i suppose but it could be going much worse as well.
					</p>
					<p>
					on an unrelated note, i've got an appointment in october to get diagnosed for ADHD. hopefully a diagnosis can help me out a bit in understanding some issues i have with school. i don't even really need the diagnosis to know i have ADHD but it'd be nice to have it confirmed and set in stone.
					</p>
					<p>
					anywho, that's all for today. it's late and i gotta wrap this up. bye!
