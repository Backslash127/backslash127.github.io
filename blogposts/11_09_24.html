				<p>11/09/24 -- MASSIVE website update!!!</p>
				
				<h2>i rewrote the whole fuckin' thing</h2>
				<hr>

				<p>it's true!</p>
				<p>i spent some time thinking and decided to rewrite the entire website from scratch. mainly because i felt the previous version had some messy code and overall it was not meeting my standards. (doesn't mean i hated it or anything though!)</p>
				<p>you may notice that the sidebar is missing, that's intentional. i'll be spending some time brainstorming a replacement for the sidebar, as it was buggy and didn't play nice with the way the website scales with screen size now.</p>
				<p>you might also notice that every previous blogpost is gone now too. why? iunno lol. i just can't be bothered to move 'em all over. and honestly none of them really mattered that much to me. we're startin' fresh now! and hopefully i can put together blogposts with more substance more consistently.

				<h2>some real talkins'</h2>
				<hr>

				<p>alright let's get down to some real shit.</p>
				<p>everything is looking pretty shitty right know. that spray-tanned scrote has been put behind the wheel of one of the most powerful countries on the planet once again, and now he's about to steer this ride straight into a lightpole in hopes of killing those he hates.</p>
				<p>i'm not one to really talk about politics, or even give a shit about it, but when it starts to involve me personally, i begin to care.</p>
				<p>this guy, who i won't even say the name of, fuckin' SUCKS!!!!! i cannot express how horrible the things are that that filth has planned for the future of many.</p>
				<p>the only thing you can do to fight back is making your voice heard. be loud, be potent, do not let yourself go unnoticed.</p>
				<p>outlive those who oppose you, fight for your life in every and any way, tooth and nail.</p>
				<p>things look bleak, but that doesn't mean it's over. keep fighting.</p>
