				<p>12/04/24 -- oops i did it again lol</p>
				
				<h2>rewrote the website again</h2>
				<hr>

				<p>i don't even have an excuse for this honestly lol. i remade the website again. don't worry! this time it's got a snazzy new coat of paint, through and through!</p>
				<p>not sure why i'm telling you this, you've already seen it by now obviously.</p>
				<p>there's still no sidebar though. but this time i've allocated some space off to the right for it whenever i get around to making it!</p>
				<p>i'd say i'm very happy with the new look of the website! there's still plenty to improve on and add. stay tuned!!!! there's more to come for the future of this website, and i bet it only gets better from here!</p>

				<h2>can you believe it guys?</h2>
				<hr>

				<p>christmas! just a week away!</p>
				<p>not actually, sorry if you believed my japery for even a moment.</p>
				<p>i had a good thanksgiving, did you have a good thanksgiving? i hope so, and if not then, sorry. hopefully it'll be better next year!</p>
				<p>i can't believe i can finally say that i ate thanksgiving turkey that wasn't super dry and nigh inedible. but, i did!!! finally! and it was actually really tasty.</p>
				<p>lots of food was made, and lots was eaten. i gotta say the highlight of this year was the mashed potatoes.</p>
				<p>a modified recipe from my dear grandma that involves sour cream, and cream cheese. me and my family added some garlic powder, salt, onion powder, and some other stuff probably. not actually confident about what we did to it but whatever we did made it REALLY GOOD.</p>
				<p>anyways, thanksgiving is over and we find ourselves at the beginning of a new month. december!!! i love christmas, but i HATE the winter weather. i live in minnesota so it gets VERY COLD and VERY WINDY whenever winter strikes. not to mention the early darkness that plagues every day of december through february (-ish).</p>
				<p>who cares about the shitty winter though? christmas is the best holiday ever! i love getting gifts, even if i get gift cards most of the time. (still debateably the best gift possible. though, visa giftcards are the best of every giftcard ever. there's no way to sway my opinion.)</p>
				<p>i'm runnin' out of things to talk about so i suppose that means i'm done lol. merry christmas y'all, thank's for paying my website a visit.</p>
