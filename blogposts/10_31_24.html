					<p>happy halloween chumps!</p>
					<p>notice the spooky coat of paint the website got? dont worry its only temporary. still cool though!</p>
					<p>ive expressed my small grievances with halloween in a previous blogpost but honestly its really not that bad.</p>
					<p>i do not participate in the festivities but yknow i completely get why people love halloween. you get to masquerade as literally anyone or anything and no one will question it.</p>
					<p>okay well maybe not <em>anyone</em>, there are some <em>less than favorable</em> individuals that are not on that roster of viable halloween costumes...</p>
					<p>if you dress up as any nasty subhuman filth then you can go fuck yourself honestly but ive never seen anyone actually do something like that so im out here just making up scenarios in my head i guess so whatever lol!</p>
					<p>i suppose the only real limit to a good halloween costume is imagination and... money.</p>
					<p>that said ive seen some pictures of some really good homemade costumes from people that only have some household materials lying around.</p>
					<p>the art of putting together halloween costumes is something pretty personal now that im thinking about it.</p>
					<p>you can spend everyday of october piecing together a masterfully crafted costume, or you can go to a spirit halloween on the 30th and pick one off a shelf in a big clear plastic pouch.</p>
					<p>im unsure of the origins of halloween and i know its a google search away but im too lazy so itll be a mystery i take to my grave i guess.</p>
					<p>i assume the origins are veryyy spooookyyyyy and scaryyyy but now halloween is just a nice little holiday where you can hang out with your friends and family to get some candy while dressed up as something, and i think thats nice.</p>
					<p>you cant forget about the days after halloween, where everyone is recovering from stuffing their maws with candy, and everyones at school trading their sick loot.</p>
					<p>alright, thats all for tonite, have fun yall! happy halloween.</p>
