					<h1 class="heading">medsszzzzz</h1>
					<p>alright ive given it some time. heres a little update about my meds and how i feel about them or something.</p>
					<p>i would say that the medication has been working pretty well for me! ive definitely been more productive in recent times. though i must say that the amount of productivity isnt as much as i was expecting, but i really shouldnt complain. ill take any boost i can get as a win.</p>
					<p>overall, ive been doing good. nothing negative so far which is great.</p>

					<h2 class="heading">some other gunk</h2>
					<p>ive been working on getting my shit together with schoolwork and anything relating to school.</p>
					<p>lots of old stuff to catch up on, lots of new stuff to keep up with.</p>
					<p>tomorrow (or the day after) im heading out to my uncles place with my dad for uhm. not sure actually, i guess just to hang out and get away from the monotony of home.</p>
					<p>funny, because i actually love staying home. i live in a pretty average suburban neighborhood and theres something about it i prefer over the midwestern countryside.</p>
					<p>thats just me though, im sure theres people out there that dig the hell out of living out in the middle of nowhere.</p>
					<p>i suppose i can see the appeal. its always nice and quiet and the scenery is very pretty.</p>
					<p>i just cant get into it though, ive been enraptured by the amenities of a modern household, with a thermostat, clean and filtered water, and all that other jazz.</p>
					<p>hmmm.... what else??? uhmmmm i dont know actually. i suppose thats all for tonight, thanks for stopping by.</p>
					<p>a lot has happened in just the last year or two, and ive had a lot of time to reshape who i am and who i want to be. and i think i can say with confidence that im happy with where im at right now.</p>
					<p>bye bye! for now at least!</p>
