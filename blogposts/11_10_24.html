				<hr>

				<p>not sure if any of y'all have ever listened to <strong>A Tribe Called Quest</strong>, but if you haven't, you absolutely should. best hip-hop group probably ever.</p>
				<p>anywho, i recently found this mixtape/album: <strong>A Quest To The Pharcyde</strong>.</p>
				<p>it's a whole album of tracks that takes the smooth, jazzy instrumentals, and the immaculate samples of ATCQ and pairs it with the slick flows of The Pharcyde.</p>
				<p>okay, now i'll admit i've never given The Pharcyde a proper listen, but i will eventually! from what i've heard from the AQTTP album, they're rhymes are GOOD.</p>
				<p>the entire AQTTP album had me smiling the entire time i was listening to it for the first time. being able to and hear all the ATCQ samples is really fun.</p>
				<p>if i'm being honest, i haven't been a fan of hip-hop for very long. but ATCQ was the first hip-hop group i truly appreciated. something about their jazzy beats had me hooked, listening nonstop every day. ever since, i've been looking for more artists to encapsulate that same feel. some have gotten close, but i've come to realize that nobody can do it like Quest.</p>
				<p>that's why AQTTP is such a mindblowing album for me. it takes literally most of the best Tribe tracks, and turns them into something new, but familiar.</p>
				<p>if you've never listened to A Tribe Called Quest, or even if you've literally never heard of them until now. PLEASE give them, and A Quest To The Pharcyde a listen. You will NOT regret it.</p>

				<p class="header">y'all play video games right</p>
				<hr>

				<p>of course you do that was just a stupid rhetoric lol.</p>
				<p>as of recent, i've been playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons. am i a few years late to the party? shitchyeah. i'm not too bummed about it though, the game is fun.</p>
				<p>between you and me, my methods of playing it are... let's just say less-than-legal. but that's completely unimportant!</p>
				<p>i've only been playing it for maybe just over a week? iunno somethin' like that.</p>
				<p>i can definitely see why this game blew the fuck up in 2020, it's awesome! pair that with the fact that millions of people, maybe even a couple billion, were stuck inside for months? the game's release couldnt've been more perfect.</p>
				<p>though, now that a global pandemic isn't around, killing millions, no one really has all that free time anymore to play ACNH all day. that includes me! i can confidently say i would enjoy the game more if i had a bunch of free time to burn. but alas i do not. i only really play for a couple hours before moving onto something im more interested in.</p>
				<p>i must also say, after doing everything that refreshes daily (visiting shops, collecting materials, etc.) there's not much else to do. maybe i'm just not creative enough to come up with stuff to do but that's kinda where i just stop for the day.</p>
				<p>there is quite a bit of waiting in ACNH. a lot of it doesn't really matter all that much, but what gets me is having to wait til the next day to recieve items from Nook Shopping. I get it, it's this weird ATM machine thing, but having to wait til the next day is kinda crazy. call me impatient all you want but i want my things!!! i bought those!!!</p>
				<p>other than that though, the game is awesome.</p>
