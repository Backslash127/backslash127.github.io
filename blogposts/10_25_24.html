					<p>well, ive got all day to do whatever, might as well sit down and write a blogpost.</p>
					<p>im sick, and im staying home from school. i stayed home yesterday too.</p>
					<p>being sick SUCKS!!! i think all ive got is a common cold, which is good i guess. but it still sucks, really bad.</p>
					<p>im coughing quite a bit and my throat is sore, so it feels like im hacking up razor blades every time i cough.</p>
					<p>took some allergy/cold meds to help, which they are. im feeling <em>okay</em> i suppose.</p>
					<p>im also drinking this tea, its the only thing i can swallow without my throat hurting. its taste though? not the most appealing honestly. im not sure how to describe it but its kinda... watered-down, if that makes sense?</p>
					<p>overall, feelin pretty shitty right now. but its fine.</p>
					<p>i dont like missing school though, not because i like it or anything. i dont like missing school because i always end up falling behind quite a bit.</p>
					<p>swear to god every teacher in this school assigns too many things. you miss just a couple of days and then youre done for.</p>
					<p>iunno, ill probably be able to get back up on my feet later, but right now things are pretty sucky.</p>
					<p>anyways, thats all for 2day, nothin else is going on in my life right now. nothing interesting at least!</p>
