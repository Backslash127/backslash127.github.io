				<h2 class="header">happy thanksgiving!!!</h2>
				<p>11/26/24</p>
				<h2 class="header">yes, i know i'm early</h2>
				<hr>

				<p>i know!!! but, i also know i'll forget to make a blogpost about this if i wait any longer, so i'm making it now!</p>
				<p>happy thanksgiving y'all.</p>
				<p>i love thanksgiving actually, quite a bit! even if it's mainly because of the food. X3</p>
				<p>i gotta say though, the way my dad cooks the turkey always has it turning out REALLY dry. it's not very pleasant if i'm being honest. sorry dad!</p>
				<p>the food item i look forward to the most every single year on thanksgiving is stovetop stuffing. i know it's basically this odd mush of croutons and butter but fuckin' hell it's so good...</p>
				<p>oh right thanksgiving is about being thankful, uhmm... iunno i've got plenty to be thankful for (ðŸ’œðŸ©µ), but i won't tell you any because i can't be bothered lol.</p>

				<h2 class="header">keepin' busy</h2>
				<hr>
				
				<p>i haven't done much with the website recently, but i'm still brainstorming ideas for a sidebar replacement.</p>
				<p>shit's tough! github pages can't do anything too fancy, so i'm still stuck with using iframes. curse you static webpages!!! X\</p>
				<p>i'm also still playing ACNH, but i've been stuck for a little. getting a three star island rating is a pain in the ass! like, oh yeah sure i'd be glad to decorate the island with some furniture! i just gotta get some first. it's a neverending dilemma between getting nice furniture and doing whatever it takes to get the island rating up.</p>
				<p>like sure i could totally just dump a bunch of random furniture everywhere but i'd rather not have to deal with the cleanup that comes after. not to mention the struggle of getting all that stuff anyways.</p>
				<p>i know there's other ways to increase your island's rating like contruction projects but WOW those are really expensive!!!! i've got a bridge to pay off and im poor as shit right now, i can't do that!!! X{</p>
				<p>i love this game but man is it just SO SLOW... i'm aware of "time-traveling" but i'm not interested. seems like a lot of gunk to deal with just to make the game go by faster. which i would like, but most of the time, time-traveling is used to get florpbillions of bells in a few minutes and that's boring as hell!!! i just wanna progress a little itty bit faster!!! blegh. X{</p>
				<p>i've lost a little motivation to do stuff recently, iunno. i don't really play as many games as i did a bit ago, and i'm not really drawing or anything like that.</p>
				<p>i might just be a little tired or getting sick of the things i've been doing recently. that's okay, i just gotta find something to do for now. i'm just sitting around doing a whole lot of nothing nowadays while thinking of things to do. none of them seem very interesting though.</p>
				<p>i've got the rest of the week off of school, that's nice. i'm definitely gonna take this time to just... relax. y'know? kick my feet up and take my mind off of school for a bit.</p>
				<p>that's all i've got for tonight, thank's for stoppin' by. :3</p>
