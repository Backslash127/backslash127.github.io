						<h1 class="heading">its been long week</h1>
						<p>yes, im aware that its only thursday but its friday tomorrow and friday is basically the weekend. let me have this.</p>
						<p>this week has felt like its gone on FOREVERRR!!! swear to god i felt every minute of this week pass by its been miserable!</p>
						<p>i was supposed to be productive this week to make up for the unproductive atrocity that was last week. but i fucked it up this week too.</p>
						<p>i think ive been inflicted with some sort of mental ailment or something because i have NOT been feeling well recently.</p>
						<p>i always tend to procrastinate on assignments and schoolwork, but recently i havent even been procrastinating.</p>
						<p>hopefully i can get myself out of whatever ive got going on because this REALLY SUCKS!!!</p>
						<p>anyways, thats all for tonight, im running out of time to write this lol bye!</p>
